# Introduction

The `BoxShuffler` package provides tools for designing and optimizing experimental layouts with randomized sample placement, adjacency conflict resolution, and metric evaluation. This vignette demonstrates a typical workflow using the package.

# Example Workflow

## Mock Data Setup

To begin, we will create a mock dataset of samples with genotypes and replicates:

```r
library(BoxShuffler)

# Create a data frame representing samples with genotypes and replicates
mock_samples <- data.frame(
  Genotype = paste0("G", 1:10),
  Reps = c(3, 5, 2, 4, 6, 3, 2, 5, 4, 3) # Number of replicates for each genotype
)

# Define experimental conditions
mock_conditions <- c("cond1", "cond2", "cond3")
```

## Configuring Box Dimensions and Parallel Processing

Next, we define the dimensions of the boxes and configure the parallel processing settings:

```r
# Box dimensions
box_rows <- 3
box_cols <- 3

# Number of iterations and cores for parallel processing
n_iterations <- 10
n_cores <- 2
```

## Generating Boxes

The `generateBoxes` function creates randomized experimental layouts with conflict resolution. Here is how to use it:

```r
# Generate mock experiment input data using the generateBoxes function
mock_box_results <- generateBoxes(
  samples = mock_samples,
  genotypes = "Genotype",
  reps = "Reps",
  conditions = mock_conditions,
  boxRows = box_rows,
  boxCols = box_cols,
  nIterations = n_iterations,
  nCores = n_cores
)
```

## Evaluating Metrics

The `scoreBoxes` function computes entropy, genotype diversity, and Simpson’s Diversity Index for the generated boxes:

```r
# Score the generated boxes to evaluate metrics
mock_scores <- scoreBoxes(mock_box_results)
```

The resulting `mock_scores` object contains detailed metrics for each experiment.

## Exporting Results

Finally, we can export the desired experiment’s results to Excel and PDF files for visualization:

```r
# Export the first experiment to Excel and PDF files
exportBox(
  experiment = 1,
  boxes = mock_box_results,
  file_name = "mock_experiment_results"
)
```

This generates:
- **Excel file:** `mock_experiment_results.xlsx` (sample placements and genotype counts)
- **PDF file:** `mock_experiment_results.pdf` (visual layout of boxes)

# Conclusion

The `BoxShuffler` package streamlines the process of experimental design by providing tools for generating, optimizing, and evaluating randomized sample placements. For further details, see the function-specific documentation.
